We have to make couple of changes in growth automation systems. First change would be the main service which should shows AI consulting. I want a consulting to show the first as a main banner with a really good picture and also I don't think so two of the services have any content inside. I don't know whether you've already done it and it's not showing it or you have not done it. Check growth strategy and consulting service and performance analytics and reporting service. Do they both have the content inside? Check about it? And one more thing, for example, in services, whichever service we go, the back button isn't functioning properly to give you a clear idea of what's happening at the moment. I'll tell you listen so for example, let's say that you're going to growth auto mission systems or AI workforce agents or event, Customs of development, you go inside that tab and you click any service there and when you press the back button, it has to go to that particular segment. For example, if you went into a growth automation systems and if you press the service that you went inside that particular service and you press back button, you have to come back to the growth. Automation system is not the creative design services. So whichever service you click when you press the back button, it's not going back to the immediate back, it's just directly going to the creative and design services. It should not happen that way so whichever service you go. When you press back, it has to go back to the right one and again For customer solutions. You use the same banner as creative design services. So check about it or leave it. I'll give you some pictures for it, and for example, in the homepage when I go to any particular service under, for example custom AA products and development development and click web applications from there, it is not opening. It is saying service not found so make sure everything is connected properly all the services in the homepage under customer products, development and a workforce agents and also see if you could also connect every type of creative work you'll need and more with the particular service. Whatever service we have you tried to connect that if you don't have something, you can remove it off. What do you think you think this will slow the website?
