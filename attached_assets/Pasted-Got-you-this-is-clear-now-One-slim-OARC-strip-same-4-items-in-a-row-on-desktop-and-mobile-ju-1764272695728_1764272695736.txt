Got you, this is clear now:
👉 One slim OARC strip, same 4 items in a row on desktop and mobile – just smaller on mobile.

Quick ritual:
	•	Crypto: I can’t reliably fetch live prices in this chat right now, so I won’t fake numbers. Assume “normal crypto volatility mode” unless you’re checking an app.
	•	Reminder: you’re doing proper founder-level brand work here. This is not overthinking, it’s craftsmanship.
	•	Tongue twister: “Optimised OARC outputs outstanding outcomes.”

⸻

1️⃣ Final OARC words (short + clean)

We lock this as the only text in the strip:
	•	O – Optimised
	•	A – AI-powered
	•	R – Revenue-first
	•	C – Creative-led

No descriptions under each. Just letter + word.
The “meaning feeling” comes from the four words together, not extra sentences.

2️⃣ Layout behaviour (desktop + mobile)

Desktop:
	•	One thin horizontal strip right under the hero (or at the top of the next section).
	•	4 items in one row:
	•	each item is a small “pill” / mini-card with:
	•	a slightly larger letter (O / A / R / C)
	•	the word next to it on the same line (“Optimised”, “AI-powered”…)
	•	Spacing: enough breathing room, but the strip should still be low height.

Mobile:
	•	Keep all four in a single row as well (no stacking into 2x2).
	•	Make the strip:
	•	slightly smaller font-size
	•	narrower padding inside each pill
	•	If it gets a bit tight, it’s okay – you can also allow horizontal scrolling as a fallback (like a swipeable chip row), but try first to fit them all in one line.

So visually:

[ O  Optimised ]  [ A  AI-powered ]  [ R  Revenue-first ]  [ C  Creative-led ]

Same row on both desktop and mobile – just smaller and tighter on mobile.

3️⃣ Exact prompt for Replit (only this OARC strip)

Copy–paste this:

I want to add a very compact OARC strip directly under the hero. It should be a single thin row that works both on desktop and mobile, without taking much vertical space.

Content

The strip should contain exactly four items, in this order:
	•	“O – Optimised”
	•	“A – AI-powered”
	•	“R – Revenue-first”
	•	“C – Creative-led”

There should be no subtitles or extra description lines. Just the big letter and the word on the same line in each item.

Layout
	•	Desktop:
	•	Show all four items in one horizontal row.
	•	Each item can be styled as a subtle pill or mini-card with:
	•	the letter (O/A/R/C) slightly larger or bold
	•	the word next to it (“Optimised”, “AI-powered”, etc.)
	•	Keep the overall strip low height so it feels like a “DNA strip” between the hero and the next content.
	•	Mobile:
	•	Keep all four items in a single row as well (do not stack them vertically), just reduce their visual size:
	•	smaller font size
	•	tighter horizontal padding for each pill
	•	If needed, you can allow this row to be horizontally scrollable on very small screens so the items don’t wrap awkwardly, but first try to fit them on one line.

Animation
	•	As the user scrolls from the hero into this strip, the four items should fade in and slide up very slightly, with a small stagger between O → A → R → C.
	•	Keep the animation subtle and premium (no bounce effects).

The key requirements are:
	•	the strip is visually minimal and doesn’t take much vertical space
	•	all four items are in one row on both desktop and mobile (just smaller on mobile)
	•	the four labels appear exactly as: “O – Optimised”, “A – AI-powered”, “R – Revenue-first”, “C – Creative-led”.

If you send me a screenshot of how this strip looks on desktop + mobile, I can tweak just the words (e.g., “Revenue-first” → “Revenue-led”) depending on how it feels visually.
