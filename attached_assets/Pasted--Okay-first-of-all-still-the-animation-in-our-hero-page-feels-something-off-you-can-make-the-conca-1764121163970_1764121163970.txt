Okay first of all still the animation in our hero page feels something off , you can make the concave animation much cleaner and more visually appealing see how it is now and make it with a good flow please , it is the the first thing that users see so we cannnot have any imperfections. And then We are going to make some very smart and heavy changes to better the overall flow of our website and make the structure more better , And more importantly I have never checked the mobile version of the website when it is tilted and has a big screen , you have to work on this , like whenever screen is titled they it can appear like a laptop version as the screen is bigger right. So this you want to check the overall website . 
So the changes are the overall website typography has to be improved a lot, the overall website with this text font and style has to be done accordingly wherever you think the text font is too big or basic style change it to the overall website , because  for sure know typography is not good and in many pages we have a big text size as well, do a research on typography or ask one more agent to study how it should be the headings or subheading or small text or anything because this is what differentiates from a normal agency to elite agency, it must not look like a vibe coding made website , it must be like a world class website designers and programmers have developed it so typography is very important and to be done for our whole website and then Icons , where ever we have any icons make sure we are using good icons not the bad ones even on this do a research and go then do changes on overall website, they must not be cheap or very outdated or the basic icons,and next colour palette and for this I don't think so there is so many changes as well have recently changed some pink to green , but see if anything or anywhere it can be improved on the overall website and NOW COMES THE VERY VERY VERY MOST IMPORTANT THING ANIMATION ANS DESIGN , this is truly the most important of all, I believe we did decently good until now but there is a difference between decently good and exceptionally smoothly well done you know? Exceptionally the homepage scrolling down in laptop or mobile both normal or title and desktop version has to be improved , and after that the overall website as well be improved in every page , the user must be feel very smooth and very easy and also new experience while using our website weather they touch our screen or especially while scrolling down from one section to another , it feels like we just took pictures and attached , it must have smooth scrolling experience you know what I mean ? Check the most advanced and latest elements and features we can implement which will make our website more elite and also at the same time better speed performance, it must not struck while you scroll down to one section to another or when you go inside of one tab into a new page , each and every function in our website must be looked like we are looking from a binoculars and improve each and every bit of it and Most importantly the overall website tech weather if it is front end or backend , we have the worlds most advanced tech so do a deep research on how you a can improve . And also we are going to make some heavy changes and as well re arrange some sections more smoothly and subtle with better user experience and all those things I mentioned to you until now . And in the Why us page, we going to change our story , for our we have shown like from 2015 we have been there and if I am
Not wrong from 2020 we started the company ( check to confirm)but now we are not going to show long history as we don’t have that big history but still we need to entice them as if we have many years of experience, so start from 2020 saying that , this is just a line and you should be a content writer here and bring a good crisp believbale content, :our team of young people we were obsessed about technology, ai and creativity and so we kind of started experimenting many things and worked under multi national companies building high end complex systems and software’s that solve real world use cases and we also were part of building the Indians first V commerce website and leading Chinese poker app and we were excited about how the next 10 years ai is going to shape and also we believe creativity is very important as being creative we believe will be the biggest asset in any industry in the future as creativity will be valued the most and that’s what will bring the revenue to any industry, though we like to believe passion is enough, we also believe at that end passion or creativity has or will
Bring Revenue , so myself and my team made a decision to  to come out and build our own company with our own core beliefs which are AI , Creativity , Revenue and should optimise all three to get the most effective result and that’s when we build our company OARC Digital in 2022, OARC meaning Optimised , AI powered , Revenue , Creative . ( replit this is for you ,before we kind of had a section in our homepage explaining OARC , we don’t have it anymore but I guess it’s a good idea to bring it again in WhY us page , so take this story and tweak it there in the why us page but the structure of the Why us page of what we have now will be the same as we build it hard and don’t want to loose it you know ,only the timeline and slight story change got it ?
So the changes are :- 

Starting from our main homepage after the section one hero page , we are adding a new small Section 2 as soon as the hero section 1 is over very subtly and not so big and you take the decision of the size and fit it should look premium just like in the picture I have attached you from
The figma design , 
Trusted by Top brands across the globe 
And display brands which we have already mentioned and some fake authentic brands across Europe , not like Nike or stuff but you can name some tech brands and these all have to have the floating animations smoothly and little fast .
After this, it has to blend very well as it is white with our new rearrange white background sectiona: Every type of creative work you will ever need , bring this particular whole section here  and below that we place the current (old 2)section where we have that phone animated design section , in this for laptop or desktop I the only change for this section is after the mobile there is so much gap and then there is we grow ambitious brands and so on so maybe you can slightly bring that up to have nice structure but for mobile version I want it be phone placed on the edge of the right side and the content The results-driven Social First Agency you've been looking for on the left side and place it nicely so it fits good and appears well , I want both in same side not above or below , then rest whatever we have in this section place that , Then comes: our Difference section , this section I don’t know what to do but the animations are very bland and looks very ordinary so do something nice and for mobile version of this make sure when you scroll it has a better animation of coming placing on to top or some kind which will not lag and also will look good ,and then Hire AI employees section willl come ( maybe you can slightly reduce the size in the laptop and desktop version ) then Here we will have Tech enabled and made to work for you section but this section will be with a new structure which is there in the sahan wireframe file under the section Tech enabled and made to work for you ( I like the structure here on how they placed the pictures so keep it like that ) did you understand? And now comes Let’s Talk Revenue section but the heading is changed to Revenue and Workflow Automations and accordingly change the tag line below but all services grids under this will stay the same , did you understand?

And then success in numbers The best return on your investment section , but this section is seems kind of off in content , maybe we should have some relastic numbers as well add on this section ? Or we do something else as well ? And then Our impact section follows , in mobile you have reduced the case studies but in laptop and desktop versions you listed everything I guess just like how it is in mobile version list it here as well ,and then testimonials section, you need to add heading here , our testimonials or something, add heading and also make this section big , it looks small both in laptop and mobile versions and then rest follows the remaining sections Pur roadmap for 202) , launching OARC AI soon  and questions and footer 

And in footer after get in touch , to avoid plagiarism change the line to something more catchy and trustworthy lines , we will
Show you how to start powerful conversation ..,, those 3 lines change to better and where there is work with us , change the colour to green from
Pink to main consistency .
