# Cabin Time

NovusWay Ministries operates youth summer camps that provide transformative religious experiences. With Cabin Time, campers can take those teachings home with them, building their faith in the comfort of their own home for the rest of the year.

## Why Cabin Time?

Kids experience a transformative faith experience at NovusWay camps. Many, though, are left wanting that experience to continue once summer camp ends.

This is why NovusWay created the Cabin Time app: after bringing parents with their children to experience camp, those parents are then equipped with this app where they can lead rituals of blessing, faith sharing, scripture reading, and prayer in the home.

With Cabin Time, parents and children are brought together to share in energizing camp-style faith practices. Nightly rituals, like those that happen at camp, can now be embraced year-round with age-specific content.

## Step into the SolutionLab.

With every new software project, non-technical stakeholders are unsure about what to expect. The SolutionLab is what brings clarity.

Cabin Time was grant-funded and required adhering to a strict budget, so our proprietary road-mapping engagement focused on identifying key functionality that would allow Cabin Time’s “version 1” to launch by camp season. Opportunities for future expansion (once user adoption was validated) were managed in a backlog and were deprioritized.

### Impact vs. effort prioritization.

When embarking on a custom software project on a strict, grant-funded budget, an important exercise is to rank each feature idea using a matrix of ‘Impact vs. Effort.’ How impactful is that feature to the user base, and how much development effort (i.e. time and money) might it take?

This is the cornerstone of how we help our clients prioritize what should be built in their agile development backlog. We tackle the most important functionality first so that our clients aren’t caught flat-footed when it’s time to launch.

### Building confidence in our team.

The SolutionLab isn’t just about getting a custom mobile app ready to code. It’s also about the intangibles: do we get along? Does the client like the members of our team that we plan to assign to the product long-term?

When meeting each discipline required to build great software and seeing actual work product from each team member, our clients are confident that they’ve made the right choice in picking their ideal software partner.

## UX/UI Design & Prototype.

Cabin Time’s user experience and user interface design centered on one key idea: how do we make an app that feels ‘campy’ and gets youth in the mood to continue their worship routine that they started over the summer?

This was accomplished with beautiful illustrations, an approachable feel and natural color scheme.

### A  dedicated product team.

When stakeholders built confidence that Designli was their custom software firm of choice, we did what we do best: assigned talented members of our team full-time to the Cabin Time project so that they could buy into the mission and work uninterrupted until that mission was accomplished.

This allowed Version 1 to be deployed rapidly, in a few short months. The app was deployed to the first camp season’s parents and their children, with feedback forming the foundation of what is prioritized moving forward.

Like any mobile app product, user feedback must be captured and prioritized rather than ignored. This is why Designli’s assigned team includes developers, but also a Graphic Designer to simulate new functionality, a Product Owner to guide the backlog, and a Quality Assurance Analyst to ensure new functionality is rolled out without breaking the existing experience.
