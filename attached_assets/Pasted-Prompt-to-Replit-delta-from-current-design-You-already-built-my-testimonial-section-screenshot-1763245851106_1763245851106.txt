Prompt to Replit (delta from current design)

You already built my “testimonial” section (screenshot I uploaded) with:
– One big quote in the middle
– One client name line below
– Two stats in a row
– Two round arrows at the bottom right

Now I want you to transform this existing section so it looks and behaves like the Superside testimonials slider in the other screenshots I uploaded.
Don’t change my colors or typography too much, just change the layout and structure.

Make these changes:

Add left avatar column

On the left side, create a vertical column with circular client photos (avatars).

The active testimonial avatar is full color and 100% opacity. The others are slightly faded (40–50% opacity).

Move quote to the center column

Keep my quote text, but move it to a center column.

At the top of this column, show the client company name (like “TechVentures”) in small all-caps.

Below that, show the big quote (keep the same font, but let important parts be bold).

Under the quote, keep the client name + role line.

Add stats + case-study area on the right

On the right side, under the quote area, show 2–3 stats in one row, similar to Superside:

Example: 68% – ROI increase in 8 months

\$850K – Annual revenue growth

Below the stats, add a small rectangular “case study” card:

small thumbnail on the left

company name and a short line like: How TechVentures scaled AI-powered campaigns with OARC Digital

Navigation / carousel behavior

Keep the up / down round arrow buttons, but move them to the vertical middle-right, next to the quote, like Superside.

When I click up or down:

Change the active testimonial (quote, stats, case study).

Switch the active avatar on the left (new one becomes full opacity).

Add a gentle fade/slide animation when changing testimonials.

Optional: autoplay every 6–8 seconds and pause when user hovers over the section.

Responsive behavior

On desktop: 3 columns (avatars / quote / stats+card).

On mobile: stack everything:

avatar on top, quote under it, stats + case-study card below, arrows at the bottom or dots for navigation.

Please implement this in React + Tailwind using my existing testimonial content, but structure and layout should be as close as possible to the Superside example.
