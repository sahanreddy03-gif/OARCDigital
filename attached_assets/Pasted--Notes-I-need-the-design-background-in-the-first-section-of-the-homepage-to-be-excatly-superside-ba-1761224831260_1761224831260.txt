Notes 
I need the design background in the first section of the homepage to be excatly superside background 
https://www.superside.com/ai-creative
And slightly bring the floating chip carousel up so that in the desktop or mobile or tablet version it’s shown as soon as they click the website and without needing to scroll down to see it , and the design has to excatly like superside 
https://www.superside.com/ai-creative
Animation , see how the floating carousel is there they have picture inside it , I need excatly like that and make sure it is of utmost high end quality and doesn’t affect the speed of the website.

Then after this comes the trusted by leading brands ,you can copy these animations and also the excat names from this page of the Superside 
https://thesocialshepherd.com/
And don’t take too much space for this we can keep this section tight.


Now 
The results - driven social first agency
I need this font just like this in social shepherd 
https://thesocialshepherd.com/

In this section , reduce the size of the phone animation, it’s too large and also keep the phone design excatly like how it’s there in social shepherd. And make sure it fits well in all the mobile or desktop or tablet version . The background here you can keep it like social shepherd.

Then our difference section 
I need a better design that blends with our above sections and also include high end animation quality picture under ai market intelligence, creative strategy, revenue centred , you can see how superiside has done these pictures , I need that quality and even the title font and colour has to be changed .

Now let’s Talk section 
Use the background and design just like superside made to flex section https://www.superside.com and also they have an animation when you scroll down on how it scrolls down , I need excatly like that in mobile version because the current design you did is okay in the desktop version but in mobile version it’s too large horizontally as we can scroll from left to right so make sure it fits well in all three versions . Even here under the AI creative , I need the floating chip carousel going from left to right a high end picture based animation style just like in our first section in the homepage and since AI creative is our main core than hire AI employees and revenue automation , we need to highlight this more but at the same time not to undersell hire ai employees and revenue automation . We need design and picture and animation changes here in this section. 

Now measurable success section : keep this more tight , reduce the size and also the design and background blend it in with the overall design 

And now roadmap and launching OARC Ai section
This is okay , see if you can make this better in terms of design and animations 

Then testimonials 
I need this a better design , this is too generic what you gave me, I need something that catches the eye design and format
