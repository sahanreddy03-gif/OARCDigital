Update the "Three Pillars / Choose Your Path" section with these micro-taglines and styling.

Text changes:
- AI Creative Services: "Content , media, and branding that captivate."
- Hire AI Employees: "Your 24/7 digital workforce — smarter, faster, scalable."
- Revenue Automation: "Automate growth. Amplify profit. Accelerate success."

Placement:
- Place each tagline directly below its corresponding pill/button.
- Tagline should be visually associated with the button (centered under it, not under the card image).
- Keep existing spacing rhythm so each pillar reads as a single unit (button → tagline → card).

Design / typographic rules (desktop & mobile):
- Font-family: inherit from current site body (match paragraph/subhead for consistency).
- Font-size: 90% of button label size (or use 14px if button is 16px).
- Line-height: 1.3
- Font-weight: 500 (medium) or match existing subheading weight.
- Color: #FFFFFF at 85% opacity (or rgba(255,255,255,0.85)) on dark backgrounds; if background is light, use #111111 at 85% opacity.
- Text alignment: centered beneath the button.
- Margins: margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px (adjust as needed for mobile).
- Max width: allow text to wrap, but keep it visually aligned with the button width (centered).
- No heavy animation; if using micro-animation, use a very subtle fade-in on scroll only.

Accessibility:
- Ensure contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 against the background. If contrast fails, slightly increase opacity or use a subtle background blur layer behind tagline.
- Taglines must be keyboard-focusable if the button is focused (for screen reader context).

Mobile rules:
- Reduce font-size to 85% of desktop tagline (e.g., 12–13px).
- Increase tap spacing: ensure at least 12–16px vertical spacing between button and tagline on mobile.
- Prevent text clipping — allow 2 lines max with ellipsis fallback if overflow occurs.

Consistency:
- Keep the same micro-tagline styling for all three pillars.
- Confirm visual balance on the actual device (test iPhone 12/13/14 viewport) and tweak margin-top between 8–12px as needed.

Testing:
- Provide screenshots of the section on both desktop and mobile after changes for review.
