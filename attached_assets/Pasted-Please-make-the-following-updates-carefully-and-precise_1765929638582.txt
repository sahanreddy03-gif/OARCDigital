Please make the following updates carefully and precisely:

1) HERO SECTION – SMOOTH FLOW (DESKTOP & LAPTOP ONLY) no changes in mobile, it’s perfect 
On desktop and laptop views only:
- The floating carousel/grid elements in the hero section currently feel delayed and slightly “stuck” while loading.

- The transition should feel premium, fluid, and uninterrupted (no visual lag or sudden jumps).
- Do NOT change anything mobile hero behavior

2) REMOVE COOKIE / PRIVACY POP-UP COMPLETELY
- Remove the cookie / privacy consent pop-up entirely.
- It should NEVER appear on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
- No “accept”, “reject”, or privacy modal should block or interrupt first-time visitors.
- Ensure this removal is permanent (not session-based, not environment-based).

3) HERO PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (IMPORTANT)
- The hero section is loading slowly, especially due to the background image.
- Please optimize hero load speed by:
  - Improving image loading strategy (compression, responsive sizing, lazy/preload where appropriate)
  - Ensuring the hero renders immediately without blocking the page
 
- The goal is: instant visual load with smooth motion, especially on desktop
You see what you can do to make it better but highest priority no changes in anything 

4) SEO & SITEMAP task and double check 

Task: Add sitemap support to this Vite + React project

Requirements:
	1.	Install vite-plugin-sitemap as a dev dependency
	2.	Update vite.config.ts to generate sitemap.xml with hostname https://www.oarcdigital.com
	3.	Ensure sitemap is generated on npm run build
	4.	Do NOT change routing, DNS, backend, or deployment settings
	5.	Do NOT add extra SEO libraries

Expected result:
Visiting /sitemap.xml on production should return a valid XML sitemap.

And then 
- Confirm sitemap.xml and robots.txt remain correct and unchanged.
- Ensure canonical URLs still point to https://www.oarcdigital.com
- Do not alter routing or page structure.

Please focus on smooth UX, performance, and correctness.
