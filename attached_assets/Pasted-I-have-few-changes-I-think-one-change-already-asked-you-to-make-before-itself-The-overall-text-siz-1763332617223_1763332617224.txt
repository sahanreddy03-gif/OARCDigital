I have few changes. I think one change already asked you to make before itself. The overall text size in the homepage of mini sections. It's kind of little large. I think you can maybe little bit reduce and this goes for the overall website. I believe and also, maybe you could see where you can have a nice elite text font And stuff like how super sweet has it if you check Super side Thailand font, it's very elite. This looks like a very basic font that you'll ever have. There is no creativity. There is no styling in any text font, especially I'm talking about the enter homepage so because that is where people definitely go first right so I need you To do this better and also the second thing which I wanted to changes again in the homepage we have every type of creative work you'll ever need and more, and there is carousel service grid going from right to left and below that there is higher employees. Carol again, you know from right to left Lets Talk revenue right these three sections What you can do is the pictures of the carousels great, which is going from right to left. there is the picture and below that there is for heading for example video production and there is a tagline effortless video production at ski first of all we can remove all the taglines. There is no need to have any tech lens because it it looks too much of text in all those three no need tech lines. Just remove it, especially for creative work. Remove those taglines, maybe for revenue automation. It's better you have it because people might not know and most importantly what you have to do is. I want you to little bit, enlarge the picture and also the heading right for example, presentation designer, social media, creative, those hitting are coming behind the picture. I wanted to come inside the picture itself. Just exactly like how Super side as done it. I'm attaching you the Super side website and also the picture of how it is and also the picture of how our website is at the moment right now. So make sure to do that for all the three. I'm talking about every type of creative work you need and hire employees and also revenue automation for all these three sections. And also remove the kind of blur we have towards the left side and right side of the screen in these three sections. If you understand what I'm trying to say, if you don't understand anything, you can clarify and then do the work. also there is a kind of like black blur and carousels grid Going from right to left on the I'm talking about the on the left side corner, right side corner for all the three sections. Remove that blur, it looks so outdated
