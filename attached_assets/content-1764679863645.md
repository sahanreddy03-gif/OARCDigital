### AI-driven data engineering to redefine over 10,000 stock cards for a national food and beverage distributor.

## Client overview

A major player in the food and beverage distribution space, this client operates across both B2B and B2C channels, supplying non-perishable goods to a wide customer base. With over 10,000+ unique SKUs and a vast operational footprint, the business depends heavily on clean, reliable data for inventory management, order processing, and customer relationship workflows. All operations are centralised through a complex ERP system integrated with legacy spreadsheets and CRM platforms.

## The challenge

Despite their scale, the client’s data ecosystem was breaking down.

They were dealing with unstructured, inconsistent, and low-quality data across critical systems—ERP, CRM, and historical spreadsheets. Product IDs were misaligned. Fields were missing. Supplier and customer records were duplicated. Formats were non-standard across categories like dates, addresses, and SKUs.

This caused a series of material business issues:

- Frequent order errors
- Delayed fulfilment and shipping
- Inaccurate inventory forecasting
- Poor reporting visibility

## The Solution: AI-Powered Data Cleansing Model

Bullshark deployed a custom AI-powered data cleansing framework designed to clean, standardise, and strengthen the client’s data architecture—without interrupting operations.

##### Data Audit Across Systems

- Mapped inconsistencies across ERP, CRM, and offline databases to build a unified data model.

##### AI-Led Record Standardisation

- NLP models were used to normalise product names, supplier codes, and category formats.
- Formatting rules applied for units of measure, addresses, SKUs, and date structures.

##### Fuzzy Matching & De-duplication

- Sophisticated data matching techniques were deployed to identify and merge duplicate records across product, customer, and supplier datasets.

##### Rule-Based Validation Engine

- Built custom rules (e.g. valid SKU patterns, category logic) to flag anomalies and incomplete fields.

##### Enrichment and Completion

- Leveraged external data sources to auto-complete address fields and supplier data, filling gaps across records.

##### Real-Time Data Quality Dashboards

- Deployed a set of dashboards that gave leadership full visibility into data health metrics across systems, supporting ongoing governance.

## The outcome

In just weeks, Bullshark transformed a fractured data ecosystem into a structured, intelligent foundation that enabled business growth.

##### Dramatic Reduction in Order Errors

Standardised product and supplier records improved system accuracy and reduced fulfilment mistakes.

##### Stronger Forecasting & Reporting

Clean, unified data allowed for precise inventory tracking and more accurate demand planning.

##### Faster Operations

Team members were no longer slowed down by inconsistent records, duplicates, or manual corrections.

##### Foundations for Scalable AI & Automation

With a clean dataset, the client is now positioned to roll out further AI automation across supply chain, pricing, and customer experience.

What was once a bottleneck is now a business enabler—driven by Bullshark’s ability to combine AI, data engineering, and strategic problem-solving in one seamless solution.
