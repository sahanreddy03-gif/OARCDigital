BUILD OARC DIGITAL — FULL SITE BLUEPRINT & IMPLEMENTATION

Context:
- Project = OARC Digital (AI-powered creative & revenue automation agency). Homepage is already in this Replit project (entry: /index.html and /src/main.tsx). Preserve current homepage exactly and reuse components/styles where possible. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- Reference style & information: Superside’s site and the attached Superside analysis document should be used as primary design/inspiration references (layout, content structure, animation style, service landing page granularity). Use those patterns liberally. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

Deliverables:
1) Convert current project into a component-driven React+TS site with routing so each of the following pages exist and are linked from the top nav:
   - Home (preserve)
   - Services (category landing)
   - All service landing pages (see Services list below)
   - Our Work (portfolio index + case study pages)
   - Why Us (team / process / AI excellence)
   - Resources (guides)
   - Pricing
   - Enterprise
   - Contact / Book a demo

Services (create each as a long-form landing page):
- Ad Creative
- Social Media Creative
- Branding & Identity
- Presentation & Pitch
- Illustration
- Print & Packaging
- Video Production
- Motion Design
- Immersive / 3D / AR
- Email Creative
- Web Design & Landing Pages
- Design Systems
- AI-Powered Creative
- AI Consulting
- HIRE AI EMPLOYEES (OARC) — dedicated page
- REVENUE AUTOMATION & GROWTH (OARC) — dedicated page
- Growth & Performance Marketing
- Paid Media & AdOps
- Organic Social Strategy

2) Use the page template pattern:
   - Hero (full-bleed with video/Lottie or high-res art) + H1 + short sub + primary CTA
   - Why/problem section (1 short block)
   - What we offer (card grid)
   - How it works (3-step / pinned scroll story for OARC)
   - Case studies gallery
   - Metrics counters
   - Testimonials
   - Closing CTA block

3) Content & copy expectations:
   - Copy must be original, non-generic, benefit-focused, and tailored per service. Use the supplied short hero & scroll lines for OARC (see prompt examples above).
   - If copying wording/format from Superside for structure is helpful, you may use it as a layout reference but do not replicate generic phrases; rewrite for OARC voice.

4) Visual assets & images:
   - Keep 8K design masters in /assets/masters but serve responsive WebP/AVIF per breakpoint using an automated image pipeline.
   - Hero loops: short 3–8s MP4/WebM or Lottie. Use Lottie for UI microinteractions and GSAP ScrollTrigger for cinematic pinned sequences.
   - All hero & key images must be ultra-high-quality (source masters 8K). On the web serve multiple sizes and lazy-load larger ones.

5) Animations & interaction rules:
   - Section entrances: fade/slide 180–220ms easing.
   - CTA hover: scale or glow 150–180ms.
   - Pinned scroll story (for the OARC hero section) must pin, then step through the four scroll states:
     “Optimised…”, “AI-Driven…”, “Revenue…”, “Creative…”, then unlock to the hero CTA.
   - Counters animate on scroll; testimonial carousel auto-play with manual controls.

6) Technical:
   - Routes: /services/[slug], /our-work/[slug], /resources/[slug]
   - Components: Hero, ServiceGrid, FeatureCard, CaseGrid, TrustedLogos, TestimonialCarousel, MetricCounters, PinnedScrollStory
   - Image pipeline: Sharp (or Replit-compatible tool) to generate WebP/AVIF + srcset.
   - SEO: metaTitle, metaDesc, OG image per page, schema.org JSON-LD for case studies.
   - Performance: critical CSS for hero, preconnect fonts, lazy-load non-critical assets.

7) Accessibility:
   - Alt text, correct heading order, keyboard focus, aria roles for carousels.

8) Content-first tasks (priority order):
   1. Map top nav & mega-menu and create skeleton routes/pages.
   2. Export existing homepage into component layout (preserve).
   3. Implement global components (Hero, FooterCTA).
   4. Build 5 highest-priority service pages first: Hire AI Employees, Revenue Automation, Web Design, Ad Creative, Social Media Creative — complete with copy, assets, and case thumbnails.
   5. Auto-generate remaining service pages using the same templates (write unique copy per page).
   6. Populate Our Work with 8 sample case studies (realistic content and outcomes).
   7. Final pass: imagery quality check, accessibility, performance audit.

Design permission:
- You are allowed to copy Superside’s layout, animation patterns, and structure as a design reference. For content, replicate structure but use original OARC copy (do not wholesale copy text). Use Superside only as UI/UX/section-reference. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

References: Use attachments “Superside Website Analysis for Replit’s Blueprint.pdf” and “Superside Website Structure and Pages.pdf” as LOE + design reference. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

Deliverable format:
- Fully linked site within this Replit project (routes working).
- A `/design-assets` folder with master 8K imagery + exported web versions.
- A `/specs/README.md` that lists each page, hero copy, CTA text, image filenames for each section, chosen animation library and precise animation timings.
- A short `handoff.zip` (or repo branch) containing image masters and the README for you to review.

Performance & Quality bar: Everything must feel cinematic, non-generic, modern (2025-grade). Animations should be subtle & purposeful. Copy must be crisp, benefit-first, and conversion-optimized.

If you understand, start by:
1) Creating the skeleton routes and components and committing to a new branch `oarc/blueprint`.
2) I will review the first 5 completed service pages and approve before you generate the remaining pages.

End of prompt.
