[**It’s no longer “if AI"—It’s “how”**](https://www.superside.com/blog/its-no-longer-if-ai) From the designer’s keyboard to the executive boardroom, creative professionals and senior leadership agree on the fact that businesses should embrace AI.Creatives in particular have little doubt about the benefits, with 96% saying AI will speed production and 93% indicating it will also elevate quality. Following suit, 89% of the executives realize how generative AI drives efficiency and unlocks new possibilities, like building custom image and illustration libraries and greater freedom and agility in concepting.With alignment on “why”—the focus shifts to “how” Everyone wants to get to the end results as quickly as possible. But, there’s more to AI transformation than simply picking the right tools. If that’s all you look at, you’ll fail more often than you succeed. Especially when the people leading change—the in-house teams—are already overcommitted.Think bigger than tools and tech

[**The Creative Struggle for Meaning in the Age of AI Adoption**](https://www.superside.com/blog/creative-struggle-ai-adoption) Imagine being a painter in the 1840s, with people traveling for weeks to be immortalized by your delicate brushwork. As you finish your latest masterpiece, adding final details, a commotion catches your attention.Outside, people marvel at a new invention—a sturdy black box that captures reality in minutes, with more detail than any painting could achieve. You feel a shiver down your spine. If just pressing a button can do what you can, what are you here for?AI adoption has come to disrupt not only every industry, from medicine to finance to marketing, but also our daily lives. Large Language Models (LLMs) began as thought partners, capable of generating text in any language, tone or style, offering fresh ideas, planning support or even challenging your thinking. Then, other types of Gen AI like image generation, voice, music and video enhancement and other tools, emerged. What used to take long hours or days (maybe months) and specific skills, is now achievable by knowing how to prompt effectively and trial and error.Our AI Consulting Team surveyed over 800 creatives from 80 different companies and more than 10 countries. We listened to their thoughts and concerns on this new wave. By now, we have a much clearer understanding of how they think and feel about their work, and the changes AI is introducing into their workflows and their lives. Here are some of the results.
