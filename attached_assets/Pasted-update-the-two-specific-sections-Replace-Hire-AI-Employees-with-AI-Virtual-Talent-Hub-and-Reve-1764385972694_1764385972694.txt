update the two specific sections: Replace “Hire AI Employees” with “AI Virtual Talent Hub” and “Revenue Workflow Automation” with “AI Revenue Ignition Engine”. Integrate these changes seamlessly while enhancing with accessibility optimizations (WCAG 2.2 AA compliant: Add semantic HTML like
roles, ARIA labels/roles (e.g., aria-labelledby for cards), alt text for all images/SVGs, keyboard-navigable carousels via tabindex/focus styles, color contrast ratios >4.5:1, screen reader-friendly content flow). Also, integrate Tailwind CSS (via CDN in : ) for benefits like rapid styling with utility classes (e.g., flex, grid, hover effects), reduced CSS bloat through purging unused styles, consistent responsive design (mobile-first breakpoints), and faster prototyping/maintainability—making the site feel engineered like Tesla’s precision interfaces. Use Tailwind classes judiciously on updated elements only (e.g., bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-teal-500, hover:scale-105 transition-transform) without conflicting with existing CSS.

Position OARC Digital as a Neuralink/Tesla-level innovator: Content evokes visionary precision—subtly highlight built MVPs (e.g., “Our production-tested MVP has transformed agencies by…”) to build credibility without hype or fake metrics. For each service, use a pain-solution-outcome structure to appeal to smart clients (e.g., real estate pros spotting frauds)—detailed, error-free, believable, focusing on tangible value like 3x efficiency or risk avoidance. Avoid unnecessary elements; ensure stunning visuals (CSS gradients/SVGs for AI-themed abstracts), animations (smooth CSS transitions/keyframe fades, parallax on heroes via transform: translateY), and UX (fast-load, intuitive, mobile-responsive with no mistakes—test for errors).
Specific Updates:
1. Home Page (index.html):
    * Locate and replace the “Hire AI Employees” section title with  AI Virtual Talent Hub (Tailwind-enhanced). Update description to: “.	Hire autonomous AI agents as on-demand team members—thinking, adapting, and executing 24/7 while slashing your hiring costs.
    * Replace “Revenue Workflow Automation” title with  AI Revenue Ignition Engine . Update description to: “Fuel your growth with automated systems—end-to-end engines that optimize pipelines, acquire customers, and validate ideas on autopilot.
    * Update services cards/carousels (floating right-to-left): Replace all old cards with new ones below. Use Tailwind for sleek cards (e.g.,  ). Carousel: Smooth auto-scroll via CSS @keyframes (e.g., animation: scroll 20s linear infinite; pause on hover with animation-play-state: paused). Make accessible (aria-live=“polite” for dynamic content). 
2. Service Pages:
    * For each service, update/create dedicated pages (e.g., sales-development-rep-agent.html). This I just a basic example, but you can improvise more if you feel like Hero ( with title/tagline), Pain Point section (detailed challenge, 150 words), Our Solution (how our AI/MVP solves it subtly, 200 words), Key Features (bullets), Benefits (outcomes, 150 words), CTA (Get Started linking to contact). Add stunning visuals (SVG AI icons with alt=“Icon representing [service]”), animations (fade-in on scroll via JS IntersectionObserver with Tailwind opacity-0 to opacity-100 transitions), parallax (CSS perspective on sections).
