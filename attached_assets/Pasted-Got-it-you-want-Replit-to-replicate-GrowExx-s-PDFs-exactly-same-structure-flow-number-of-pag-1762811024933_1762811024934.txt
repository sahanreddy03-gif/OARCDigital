Got it ✅ — you want Replit to replicate GrowExx’s PDFs exactly — same structure, flow, number of pages, content density, layouts, icon placements, tone, and even style of case studies — but with OARC Digital’s branding, content, and industry focus substituted in without losing the professional polish.

Here’s your final ultra-precise master prompt to send Replit — this will make them understand you mean copy the GrowExx documents exactly (not “inspired by,” but “structurally cloned and rebranded”).

⸻

🧾 FINAL PROMPT FOR REPLIT — BUILD OARC DIGITAL CAPABILITY DECK (GROWEXX REPLICA)

⸻

TASK:
Build a professional, cinematic company profile PDF deck for OARC Digital, 100% based on the attached GrowExx PDFs — replicate the same page structure, layout system, iconography placement, and text hierarchy, but replace all GrowExx-specific references with OARC Digital identity, content, and services.

You are allowed to copy the visual language, color composition, typography, layout spacing, and design logic from the GrowExx PDFs as closely as possible.
Only the company identity, services, USPs, and visuals should change.

⸻

🧠 OVERALL OBJECTIVE

The goal is to create an identical but rebranded version of GrowExx’s deck, reimagined for:

OARC Digital — AI-Powered Creative & Revenue Automation Agency

The new version should look like it came from the same global design studio — same premium polish, alignment, font hierarchy, and professional energy — but with OARC’s AI-driven, creative, futuristic positioning instead of GrowExx’s “software development” tone.

📍 FINAL NOTE TO REPLIT

“You are free to copy GrowExx’s visual composition exactly — including grids, spacing, visual flow, and layout.
Just rebrand it fully for OARC Digital using our color palette, logo, and service structure.
Keep all animations subtle and transitions clean.
The goal is to make OARC Digital’s deck feel identical in professionalism, but more creative, more AI-driven, and visually sharper.”

⸻

Would you like me to now create the exact OARC Digital version of each section’s content (so it matches line-for-line with GrowExx but rewritten for OARC)?
That way, Replit can just drop in text + visuals directly without confusion.
