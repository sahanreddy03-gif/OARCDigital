There are few changes we have to do first thing and noticing right now when I am using through mobile or through laptop, especially if it's being through mobile and when I'm just in the section of especially these three sections, I would say what type of creative work will ever need and higher AI employees and let's talk revenue. So when I am in the sections and when I try to scroll up or scroll down or stay in the middle, it's getting struck. It's very slow and also in the phone and I'm trying to click or just click on any picture. It's going no browser is found, so I feel there is some kind of a glitch over here or when you try to enlarge the pictures or something became more slow or it is having some glitches, so this is something you have to fix an apart from this. I realise one more thing when you see the Super site.com, how they have like a big carousel when you see like from laptop or iPad, but at the same time when you go to the Mobile version, they have little bit. Reduce the size or it looks little reduced so that it's it look better for the user. Maybe we could do the same as well, and also we could improve the clarity in general in regards of the type of text. You use there Then once you're done with this, I think for higher AI employees and let's talk revenue for these two, maybe we could do little bit different because all the three feels exactly like the same. I mean, every type of creative work that is big carousel. It's going. That's really nice. Let's not touch that or not the size but for the AI employees and let's talk revenue. I guess we could maybe change the motion or change maybe a little bit of size or maybe one can go from left or right and one can go from right to left or maybe revenue automation we could have this circle kind of grids. I'm not sure something different. I feel it's better but again like I have to stress, this point, make sure that it's Speed and there is no glitches. Whenever we try to be in this and in the Mob in the mobile version, you should be able to maybe minimise it a bit. Go check how it's looking the mobile version of Super site and also the desktop version of it. And again, the overall homepage, the text font size could be maybe a little bit reduced in some cases and also try to see if you can make the text style font more elite. It looks very generic and very basic. Especially the quality of the Car Sales's grid which we have from Super side. It's I'm not able to compare that with this because the Super sides are like the bit better done and also, especially when I'm using through phone, I can literally touch those grids and make it left or right or whatever, and the Speed is also really good with them so you need to see how you can improve the quality for all those three and is there anything different shit we could do in terms of Lets Talk revenue on higher AI employees because all three looks like exactly same. So all these points you'll have to first work on.
