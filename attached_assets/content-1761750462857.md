## Human-led influencer approach

Too many influencer agencies rely solely on tech and influencer search platforms to guide their entire campaign, but we knew there was a better way.

We take a more human-led approach and then use tech to confirm our research and campaign development.

This looks at how we research potential influencers, how we analyse their metrics, and how they have performed on previous campaigns.

Our team is extremely thorough when it comes to the planning phase, so we can truly get the best influencers for your brand, while delivering efficiency of your budget.

## End-to-end Campaign Management

We can handle it all, from campaign strategy, research, insights, outreach, briefing, approvals, payment, analysis, and delivery.

Some brands want to be heavily involved, while others prefer a hands-off approach. So our ways of working allow us to mould to your exact needs.

## Creators for User-generated Content

Not only do we deliver Influencer campaigns, but we've built our creator pools, who can produce social-first content for your social channels.

Creators have a unique ability to create content that's socially native, produced specifically for each individual platform, so we decided to harness it!

Not used for their 'influence', but as another means of production. We then use that content on your owned brand channels, not their own channels.

So if you're a brand looking for UGC content for Organic or Paid channels or a creator yourself, get in touch.
