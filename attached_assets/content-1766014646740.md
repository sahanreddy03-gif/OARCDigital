## Where we shine and helped  ‍500+ GTM teams with

## Your results timeline  what happens after onboarding

Week 1 & 2:

Define & Setup

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/680bdeb0f701e6b324eaa451/693eba8db88636dc8d7bc276_Process%20Container.svg)

### Build the foundations of your GTM engine.

We align on your ICP, map your accounts, build your messaging, and connect the tools. By the end of Week 2, every core system is live and ready for launch, with a shared dashboard that lets you see everything in one place.

Weeks 3 & 4:

Create & Launch

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/680bdeb0f701e6b324eaa451/693eba8d237942d98b8f6e42_Group%201261152806.svg)

### Craft your email sequences and build your lead lists.

In Weeks 3 and 4, we publish your first content sprint, launch ABM ads, and send the first outbound sequences to warm ICP contacts. This is where the Flywheel starts to move, and real engagement data appears in your dashboard.

Month 2 :

Amplify & Convert

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/680bdeb0f701e6b324eaa451/693eba8d1ad3446d89d6b73d_Group%201261152808.svg)

### Double down on winners and turn engagement into pipeline.

By Month 2 we know what is resonating. We scale the best content and ads, expand your target lists, and create automations so every warm signal flows into outbound follow-ups and pipeline.

Month 3 :

Learn & Scale

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/680bdeb0f701e6b324eaa451/693eba8da6ce1c2047ddeb73_Group%201261152809.svg)

### Turn the Flywheel into a repeatable system.

In Month 3, the focus shifts from experimentation to repeatability. We promote winning content into BOF ads, scale successful outbound frameworks, and document everything into a playbook and growth roadmap for the next quarter.

After Day 90 :

What Happens Next

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/680bdeb0f701e6b324eaa451/693eba8d85fe6122f047fd1c_Group%201261152810.svg)

### Pilot proven, next step is your call.

At Day 90, we sit down for a Flywheel Performance Review. We look at pipeline created, cost per opportunity, winning messages, and how each channel contributed. If the results are strong, we move into a 6-month strategic partnership to scale what works. If not, you still leave with a complete playbook, assets, and a working system.

Evan Dorfman

COO

The ColdIQ team is everything you'd want in a consulting partner - true experts with both strategic insight and hands-on execution. They took us from zero to a fully built, high-performing cold outreach engine. From weekly check-ins to goal tracking, they guided us every step of the way. Thanks to their system, we generated over 300 positive replies and built a solid pipeline. Highly recommend going with them for cold outreach set up. If you want to win at cold outreach, you need to be on the cutting edge - and ColdIQ is already operating at the bleeding edge.

Christian Hed

CMO

ColdIQ managed to create a total of 30 sales opportunities throughout our collaboration. They made countless efforts and I feel like they really pushed the limit for us and that really was eye-opening! They built an operator lookup that allowed us to know more about potential clients which opened the door for endless outbound possibilities. They ran lots of testing to reevaluate our ICP and built a website visitor campaign that allowed us to send personalized messages to prospects who fit in our ICP. Communication was really one of the big positive point as they would always let us know about any update in the campaigns. Last week we saw a big opportunity in the market and they launched a campaign 15 minutes later! We would recommend 100%

Braden Nolan

Vice President

It's been a pleasure working with the ColdIQ team. We've reached a total of almost 14,000 leads, that led to 32.8% reply rate, which is a unique positive replies of 103, totaled at 314 unique replies out of that. They really opened up our eyes to deliverability within the cold email market. ColdIQ is very good at getting into people's inboxes, delivering the right message, and being able to formulate a response back from those customers.

Yee Lin Loke

Director & Digital Strategist

It's been the best collaboration and experience working with ColdIQ. In terms of communication, we get quick response and all the information are well explained. I think that was the most insane campaign that I've seen so far. There were about 80+ positive leads that actually came through over a month. It was massive list of leads.100% highly recommended!

I feel super supported working with ColdIQ and like I'm not the only one bringing ideas to the table. Everyone is included and you are on top of whether I am happy or not and we meet consistently so that we know we are on the same page with what is happening. You stay on top of how we can best leverage the tools to improve the results for us. Right now we are consistently getting between 5-8 leads per day and between 1-3 customers which is pretty solid.

Working with ColdIQ team has been great and super easy. They're really true partners. They provided a lot of insights into how we can grow.

We're using ColdIQ actually to make leads and prospects aware that we have a product and a solution. You guys have a lot of experience in particular, ensuring that we reach out to the right people, the tone of voice, the length of the methods, just ensuring that people have a value add when we reach out to them. You've really cracked away also on the tech side using the right tools, right methodology, use the channels we have the wisest way possible and get the right attention.

Brian Ragone

CEO & Founder

Prior to working with ColdIQ, we were sending all of our messages manually to try to get business and some of our campaigns were performing very poorly. Working with ColdIQ is super collaborative I actually felt that they were part of our team. We could understand the space, sales tools and perspectives. In those few months, we went from literally zero foundations of outbound to driving about 77 leads. They literally learned and built the foundation for the messaging and go to market ICP for us.

In the last 24 hours, ColdIQ sent me 5 good quality leads and around 25 leads in 3 months, with 20 meetings booked and closed a fair number of those as well. Some of the Clay tables from ColdIQ were fantastic and being able to personalize messages at scale really helped us in getting really good quality leads which is obviously the aim of the game.

Austin Evans

VP of Sales

Conversion from response to booking a meeting was very strong. We got 250 leads per month with up to 40% conversion rate and appointments set to 100 meetings per month. ColdIQ has a unique and novel approach to what they are doing. Their work is unique compared to every other one that I've seen.

Paloma Hernández

Head of Sales

Constantly, we've been receiving leads every day on a weekly basis between 6 and 15 replies and this started on week 2. Three of those replies have already become existing clients. We didn't have to wait a long time, the conversion rate is great.

Shaazia Ebrahim

Head of Marketing

The ColdIQ team has been great and collaborative. At the beginning of the process, it was very useful to dig really deep into what our target ICP is, who we're trying to reach out to really understand what we're trying to say to them. We're able to bring in a good number of leads in through the pipeline, about 4 leads a week.

Brian Ragone

CEO at Puzzle

“Prior to working with ColdIQ, we were sending all of our messages manually to try to get business and some of our campaigns were performing very poorly. Working with ColdIQ is super collaborative I actually felt that they were part of our team. We could understand the space, sales tools and perspectives. In those few months, we went from literally zero foundations of outbound to driving about 77 leads. They literally learned and built the foundation for the messaging and go to market ICP for us”.

I reached out to ColdIQ because we had issues with our outbound marketing. We couldn’t quite get where we wanted to be and felt short of ressources. We worked with them and I wished I reached out to them earlier in the process. Time and money would have been saved. I knew how to pin point out directly what we needed to do. They know the tools they works with like the back of their hands. Hats down to the Maestro, sincerely, thank you. I won’t wait so long the next time I want to reach out.

“Prior to working with ColdIQ, we were sending all of our messages manually to try to get business and some of our campaigns were performing very poorly. Working with ColdIQ is super collaborative I actually felt that they were part of our team. We could understand the space, sales tools and perspectives. In those few months, we went from literally zero foundations of outbound to driving about 77 leads. They literally learned and built the foundation for the messaging and go to market ICP for us”.

The ColdIQ team actually really care about results for your clients. We've landed three to four very large multi-billion dollar landlords and it's just fascinating. Whether I'm traveling or doing other things, emails are always going out.

In the last 24 hours, ColdIQ sent me 5 good quality leads and around 25 leads in 3 months, with 20 meetings booked and closed a fair number of those as well. Some of the Clay tables from ColdIQ were fantastic and being able to personalize messages at scale really helped us in getting really good quality leads which is obviously the aim of the game”.

I reached out to ColdIQ because we had issues with our outbound marketing. We couldn’t quite get where we wanted to be and felt short of ressources. We worked with them and I wished I reached out to them earlier in the process. Time and money would have been saved. I knew how to pin point out directly what we needed to do. They know the tools they works with like the back of their hands. Hats down to the Maestro, sincerely, thank you. I won’t wait so long the next time I want to reach out.

Jessie Litwin

Sales Outreach Consultant at Hemlane

“Working with ColdIQ team has been great and super easy. They're really true partners. They provided a lot of insights into how we can grow. They are detail-oriented and very focused on over-communication and I really felt that we had an understanding of what's going on and where we could make improvements. Our open rates, response rates, and positive connection rates all went above industry average”.

Brian Ragone

CEO at Puzzle

“Prior to working with ColdIQ, we were sending all of our messages manually to try to get business and some of our campaigns were performing very poorly. Working with ColdIQ is super collaborative I actually felt that they were part of our team. We could understand the space, sales tools and perspectives. In those few months, we went from literally zero foundations of outbound to driving about 77 leads. They literally learned and built the foundation for the messaging and go to market ICP for us”.

“It's been the best collaboration and experience working with ColdIQ. In terms of communication, we get quick response and all the information are well explained.

Joe DeWulf

“I feel super supported working with ColdIQ and like I'm not the only one bringing ideas to the table. Everyone is included and you are on top of whether I am happy or not and we meet consistently so that we know we are on the same page with what is happening. You stay on top of how we can best leverage the tools to improve the results for us. Right now we are consistently getting between 5 -8 leads per day and between 1-3 customers which is pretty solid”.

“It's been great working with ColdIQ in helping us identify new opportunites to go for. In the last 24 hours, ColdIQ sent me 5 good quality leads and around 25 leads in 3 months, with 20 meetings booked and closed a fair number of those as well. Some of the Clay tables from ColdIQ were fantastic and being able to personalize messages at scale really helped us in getting really good quality leads which is obviously the aim of the game”.

## Frequenlty asked questions

How quickly can you launch a campaign?

From the moment you sign a contract, you should count 2 weeks before seeing your first campaign live. The first weeks are dedicated to building your email infrastructure. We’ll set up secondary domains and mailboxes and warm these up. During the warm-up process, we build your lead lists and draft your email (&/or LinkedIn) sequences. This process usually takes 2 weeks – which means that we send our first outreach messages by week 3.

How do you protect my domain reputation? Will my emails land in spam if we send too many?

We don’t use your primary domain to send our outreach emails. If you’re doing so, you should stop already, as it can have some disastrous impact on your domain reputation overall. We create secondary domains that redirect to yours. We then create mailboxes to send our emails. Whatever happens with these domains – your main domain reputation is safe. Because we have a handful of different domains, we can scale our sending volume in a safe way.

What visibility do I have on the process? Do I get to see the messages and who you’re reaching out to?

Once our first drafts are ready, we’ll send them your way for review. We won’t send any messages you’re not happy with. Similarly, we send you the list of prospects we plan to contact before doing so. If you’re not happy with our targeting criteria, we’ll revise and recreate these lead lists.

What is the pricing model like? Do I need to commit for several months at once?

We charge a monthly retainer. At the start of our engagement, we want you to commit to the first three months, as we find this to be a reasonable time period to assess whether campaigns will be successful or not.
After that, there is no long-term commitment or lock-in. Our goal is to win your business every month by providing a service you’re happy to keep paying for.

Are there any upfront fees or hidden costs?

We create a client login in our sending tool. With this, you get a view of every relevant metric, such as:
\- The number of leads contacted
\- The number of emails we send
\- The percentage of leads that opened our emails
\- The percentage of positive replies On top of that, we track additional metrics such as your email-to-lead ratio, contact-to-lead ratio and we further enrich results to get a sense of what are your best performing target segments.
