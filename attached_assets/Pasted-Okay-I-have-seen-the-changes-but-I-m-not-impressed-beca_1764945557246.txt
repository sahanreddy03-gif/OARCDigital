Okay, I have seen the changes, but I'm not impressed because you're trying to put too many video placing holders and more more about that everything I think you telling them as it's like 14 days structure or something like that it has to feel genuine and everything can't be the same, and you have to take up your own decisions and own creativity and won't content structure design According to each service, I can't be keep on spoon feeding everything. I'm going to give you permission to prompt yourself to make it into a great service page. Go back to the world notes and even get through this note. See what is good in that. The whole goal is to make sure that we are not just a website who just did copy the content from ChatGPT and just you know, made the content for each service. It is easy. Anyone can do that, but we are not just that we should be able to tell them That we are genuine have done solutions right but not in terms of key metrics or stuff. They should be a better way. I like it. What you did. I'm not saying no, but also for example, I just went through only one I went to the video production. The way you said it is good. It is good. I'm not saying it is not good. It is good, and there is one kind of animation What stack we use and there are few services they are going a bit too slow little bit fasten it up and also and also the same video production content which we had before, and you changed it now even from there, also, I believe you can take something good in it. You don't need to completely avoid or undo what we have done. yes, change it to the best way possible no problem, but if there is something you can use it, use it wisely as well. Just to be smarter about it. You know, for example when it comes to video production, I feel like this particular content, not the design content, maybe we can use it as well. You know. So apply this kind of smartness. This kind of approach to all the services because I don't. We don't want to be just spending too much time on building. Everything just want to make it better. We already have services and how do we make it even more better? Is our goal, not that again you have to start everything from scratch if something is needed to be done. Good yes you can do good. If there are some banner pictures. There are some really good banner pictures which we used before, yes, you can use that be smart about everything. You have to take up your own decisions. Not. I won't be able to spoon for you because I'm not a genius. I'm just a visionary you have to think as a visionary and the technical part of it, they'll be so many things I wouldn't know you should be able to do it smartly fastly, not wasting too much, Money.
