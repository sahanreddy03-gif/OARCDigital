🔴After this comes the performance metrics :- be creative in this and show it in a very simple and unique way in one line animated way , the reason being people actually have to see it rather than just thinking it’s fake generic 

So ROi is okay but others you mentioned are very generic and use like for example cost saved increased customer retention and brand recognition something that are not very generic and make people look
