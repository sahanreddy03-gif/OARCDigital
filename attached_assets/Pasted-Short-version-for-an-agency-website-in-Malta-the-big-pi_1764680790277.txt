Short version: for an agency website in Malta, the big pillars are GDPR + Maltese data protection law, cookies, consumer law, advertising rules, and proper company info on the site. I’ll walk you through them in simple, practical terms.

Not legal advice, just a structured checklist so you don’t accidentally break anything. For anything serious, a Maltese lawyer/consultant is still worth it.

⸻

1. Data protection (GDPR + Malta Data Protection Act)

In Malta you must follow EU GDPR and the Malta Data Protection Act (Cap. 586). ￼

For your agency website this means:

a) Privacy Policy (non-negotiable)

You need a clear privacy policy that explains:
	•	Who you are (trading name + legal entity + address + contact email).
	•	What data you collect via:
	•	Contact forms (name, email, phone, company, etc.)
	•	Newsletter sign-ups
	•	Analytics tools (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, etc.)
	•	Why you collect it (legal basis: e.g. “performance of a contract”, “legitimate interest”, or “consent”).
	•	How long you keep it and who you share it with (hosting, email provider, CRM, analytics tools, etc.).
	•	User rights under GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection, data portability, complaint to IDPC). ￼

The Information and Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC) website has guidance and even self-assessment tools to help check compliance. ￼

b) Data handling basics
	•	Only ask for data you need (data minimisation).
	•	Store it securely (HTTPS, strong passwords, 2FA on email/CRMs, limited access).
	•	If you use tools outside the EU (e.g. some US SaaS), you may need appropriate data transfer safeguards (Standard Contractual Clauses, etc.). ￼

2. Cookies & tracking (very important for a marketing/AI agency)

Malta follows the EU rules on cookies & ePrivacy. The IDPC issued a Guidance Note on Cookie Consent Requirements with clear examples of acceptable vs unacceptable methods. ￼

What you must do
	1.	Cookie banner when someone first visits:
	•	Explain you use cookies.
	•	Let them accept / reject / manage non-essential cookies (analytics, marketing).
	•	No pre-ticked boxes, no “accept only” dark pattern.
	2.	Cookie policy page:
	•	List cookie types (necessary, analytics, marketing).
	•	Who sets them (first-party vs third-party).
	•	How long they last and how users can change their settings.
	3.	Only essential cookies can load automatically.
	•	Analytics, remarketing pixels, and tracking scripts should load only after consent.

3. Consumer & e-commerce rules (even if you’re mainly B2B)

Even as a B2B agency, your website falls under EU/Malta consumer & e-commerce rules if any private individual can buy or order services online.

Key laws are the Consumer Affairs Act (Cap. 378) and Consumer Rights / Distance Selling regulations. ￼

a) Information you must show on the site

Before a client is bound by a contract or pays, you must clearly show: ￼
	•	Your business name and legal entity.
	•	Geographical address (not just a PO box).
	•	Email + phone for contact.
	•	VAT number and registration details, if applicable.
	•	Main characteristics of services (what exactly they’re getting).
	•	Price and how it’s calculated, including any taxes/fees.
	•	How the contract is formed (e.g. “By clicking ‘Confirm’, you agree to our Terms”).
	•	If you sell to consumers online: info about cooling-off / cancellation rights.

Under EU/MT distance-selling rules, consumers normally have 14 days to cancel many online service contracts (with specifics and exceptions) and get a refund. ￼

b) Terms & Conditions (T&Cs)

Have a T&Cs page that covers:
	•	Scope of your services.
	•	Payment terms (upfront, milestones, late-payment consequences).
	•	Refund/cancellation rules.
	•	Intellectual property (who owns creatives, code, AI outputs).
	•	Liability limitations (within what’s allowed by law).
	•	Governing law & jurisdiction (usually “Laws of Malta, courts of Malta”).

4. Advertising, marketing and “no scammy stuff”

As a marketing / AI agency, this is critical: Malta has strong rules on misleading and unfair commercial practices, aligned with the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.
	•	Consumer Affairs Act, Commercial Code, and related rules ban misleading advertising and unfair design tricks (“dark patterns”). ￼
	•	Deceptive advertising is also regulated via the Broadcasting Act and other laws. ￼

For your site:
	•	Don’t claim things you can’t prove (e.g. “We guarantee 10x revenue”).
	•	Don’t fake testimonials, case studies, or logos of clients you never worked with.
	•	If you use before/after examples, they must be honest and non-manipulated.
	•	Don’t hide important information in tiny grey text or behind confusing flows (dark patterns).

If you ever do influencer marketing or pay creators to promote you, posts need to be clearly labelled as ads (#ad, “Sponsored”, etc.), or it can be considered misleading. ￼

5. Email, SMS & outbound marketing rules

Under electronic communications rules and EU privacy law, you must: ￼
	•	Get opt-in consent before sending marketing emails/SMS to individuals (newsletter forms, free lead magnets, etc.).
	•	Always include a clear unsubscribe option that actually works.
	•	For pure B2B cold outreach, rules are a bit more flexible, but you must still:
	•	Contact only relevant businesses,
	•	Provide an easy opt-out,
	•	Respect GDPR if you’re using their personal work email (it’s still personal data).

6. Intellectual property & content use

Smart things to do so you don’t get into trouble later:
	•	Use proper licenses for:
	•	Stock photos/videos,
	•	Fonts,
	•	Icons,
	•	Music in reels/ads.
	•	If you show client logos or work, either:
	•	Get written permission,
	•	Or clearly state it as “mockup” / “concept work” and don’t misrepresent.
	•	Put a copyright notice in the footer:
	•	© 2025 OARC Digital (or your brand). All rights reserved.
	•	Specify in your T&Cs who owns:
	•	Raw files (editable PSD/AI/Figma),
	•	AI prompts & workflows,
	•	Final creatives and ad copies.

7. Security & “good citizen” practices

They’re not just “nice to have”—they support your GDPR compliance and reputation:
	•	HTTPS mandatory (SSL certificate).
	•	Regular backups of site + CRM.
	•	Minimal access for team/freelancers (principle of least privilege).
	•	Clear process if there’s a data breach (GDPR requires reporting serious ones to IDPC within 72 hours). ￼

8. Simple checklist for your Malta agency website

When you launch OARC/your agency site, aim to have all of this:
	1.	Legal/identity
	•	✅ Legal entity name, address (Malta + others if you show them), contact email+phone.
	•	✅ VAT number (if registered) visible in footer or contact/about section.
	2.	Policies
	•	✅ Privacy Policy (GDPR-compliant, easy to read).
	•	✅ Cookie Policy + functional cookie banner with consent.
	•	✅ Terms & Conditions (services, payments, IP, liability, law/jurisdiction).
	3.	Website UX & content
	•	✅ No fake guarantees, no “too good to be true” metrics that you can’t justify.
	•	✅ Honest case studies and testimonials.
	•	✅ No dark patterns (e.g. tricky opt-outs, sneaky extra fees at checkout).
	4.	Forms & marketing
	•	✅ Explicit consent boxes for newsletter/marketing (not pre-ticked).
	•	✅ Unsubscribe link in all marketing emails.
	•	✅ Secure handling of contact form submissions (not sending them to random shared inboxes without control).
	5.	Tech & security
	•	✅ HTTPS, strong passwords, 2FA on email/hosting/CRMs.
	•	✅ Logically documented list of tools where you store client data (for your own GDPR sanity).

If you want, next step I can:
	•	Draft ready-to-use outlines for:
	•	Privacy Policy,
	•	Cookie Policy,
	•	Short T&Cs specifically for a Malta-based AI/creative agency,
so you can give them to a Maltese lawyer for quick review instead of starting from zero.
