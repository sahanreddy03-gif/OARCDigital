BUILD OARC DIGITAL — FULL SITE BLUEPRINT & IMPLEMENTATION

Context:
- Project = OARC Digital (AI-powered creative & revenue automation agency). Homepage is already in this Replit project (entry: /index.html and /src/main.tsx). Preserve current homepage exactly and reuse components/styles where possible. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- Reference style & information: Superside’s site and the attached Superside analysis document should be used as primary design/inspiration references (layout, content structure, animation style, service landing page granularity). Use those patterns liberally. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

Deliverables:
1) Convert current project into a component-driven React+TS site with routing so each of the following pages exist and are linked from the top nav:
   - Home (preserve)
   - Services (category landing)
   - All service landing pages (see Services list below)
   - Our Work (portfolio index + case study pages)
   - Why Us (team / process / AI excellence)
   - Resources (guides)
   - Pricing
   - Enterprise
   - Contact / Book a demo

Services (create each as a long-form landing page):
- Ad Creative
- Social Media Creative
- Branding & Identity
- Presentation & Pitch
- Illustration
- Print & Packaging
- Video Production
- Motion Design
- Immersive / 3D / AR
- Email Creative
- Web Design & Landing Pages
- Design Systems
- AI-Powered Creative
- AI Consulting
- HIRE AI EMPLOYEES (OARC) — dedicated page
- REVENUE AUTOMATION & GROWTH (OARC) — dedicated page
- Growth & Performance Marketing
- Paid Media & AdOps
- Organic Social Strategy

2) Use the page template pattern:
   - Hero (full-bleed with video/Lottie or high-res art) + H1 + short sub + primary CTA
   - Why/problem section (1 short block)
   - What we offer (card grid)
   - How it works (3-step / pinned scroll story for OARC)
   - Case studies gallery
   - Metrics counters
   - Testimonials
   - Closing CTA block

3) Content & copy expectations:
   - Copy must be original, non-generic, benefit-focused, and tailored per service. Use the supplied short hero & scroll lines for OARC (see prompt examples above).
   - If copying wording/format from Superside for structure is helpful, you may use it as a layout reference but do not replicate generic phrases; rewrite for OARC voice.

4) Visual assets & images:
   - Keep 8K design masters in /assets/masters but serve responsive WebP/AVIF per breakpoint using an automated image pipeline.
   - Hero loops: short 3–8s MP4/WebM or Lottie. Use Lottie for UI microinteractions and GSAP ScrollTrigger for cinematic pinned sequences.
   - All hero & key images must be ultra-high-quality (source masters 8K). On the web serve multiple sizes and lazy-load larger ones.

5) Animations & interaction rules:
   - Section entrances: fade/slide 180–220ms easing.
   - CTA hover: scale or glow 150–180ms.
   - Pinned scroll story (for the OARC hero section) must pin, then step through the four scroll states:
     “Optimised…”, “AI-Driven…”, “Revenue…”, “Creative…”, then unlock to the hero CTA.
   - Counters animate on scroll; testimonial carousel auto-play with manual controls.

6) Technical:
   - Routes: /services/[slug], /our-work/[slug], /resources/[slug]
   - Components: Hero, ServiceGrid, FeatureCard, CaseGrid, TrustedLogos, TestimonialCarousel, MetricCounters, PinnedScrollStory
   - Image pipeline: Sharp (or Replit-compatible tool) to generate WebP/AVIF + srcset.
   - SEO: metaTitle, metaDesc, OG image per page, schema.org JSON-LD for case studies.
   - Performance: critical CSS for hero, preconnect fonts, lazy-load non-critical assets.

7) Accessibility:
   - Alt text, correct heading order, keyboard focus, aria roles for carousels.

8) Content-first tasks (priority order):
   1. Map top nav & mega-menu and create skeleton routes/pages.
   2. Export existing homepage into component layout (preserve).
   3. Implement global components (Hero, FooterCTA).
   4. Build 5 highest-priority service pages first: Hire AI Employees, Revenue Automation, Web Design, Ad Creative, Social Media Creative — complete with copy, assets, and case thumbnails.
   5. Auto-generate remaining service pages using the same templates (write unique copy per page).
   6. Populate Our Work with 8 sample case studies (realistic content and outcomes).
   7. Final pass: imagery quality check, accessibility, performance audit.

Design permission:
- You are allowed to copy Superside’s layout, animation patterns, and structure as a design reference. For content, replicate structure but use original OARC copy (do not wholesale copy text). Use Superside only as UI/UX/section-reference. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

References: Use attachments “Superside Website Analysis for Replit’s Blueprint.pdf” and “Superside Website Structure and Pages.pdf” as LOE + design reference. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

Deliverable format:
- Fully linked site within this Replit project (routes working).
- A `/design-assets` folder with master 8K imagery + exported web versions.
- A `/specs/README.md` that lists each page, hero copy, CTA text, image filenames for each section, chosen animation library and precise animation timings.
- A short `handoff.zip` (or repo branch) containing image masters and the README for you to review.

Performance & Quality bar: Everything must feel cinematic, non-generic, modern (2025-grade). Animations should be subtle & purposeful. Copy must be crisp, benefit-first, and conversion-optimized.

If you understand, start by:
1) Creating the skeleton routes and components and committing to a new branch `oarc/blueprint`.
2) I will review the first 5 completed service pages and approve before you generate the remaining pages.

Hero image brief

Feed-style loop: quick vertical video montage, user comments floating, an overlay CTA pop. Colors: warm, social-native saturation; 5–8s loop. ASSET BRIEF — OARC DIGITAL: CREATE HIGH-END, NON-GENERIC VISUAL ASSETS

Context:
- Project: OARC Digital (AI + Media + Revenue automation agency).
- Homepage preserved in repo. New pages will use cinematic, art-directed hero images and short loops. All images must be original (not generic stock), premium, and delivered as 8K masters plus optimized web exports.
- Use these reference sites for visual inspiration & pacing: 
  - https://www.superside.com
  - https://sociallypowerful.com
  - https://thesocialshepherd.com
  - https://coldiq.com
- DO NOT copy text from references — copy design/structure only. Visuals must feel unique to OARC Digital.

General Requirements (apply to every visual asset):
1. Masters: Produce **8K masters** (7680 × 4320 px) as TIFF/ProRes sequences for videos or layered PSD/EXR for stills. Place masters in `/design-assets/masters/`.
2. Web exports: From each master create optimized variants in `/design-assets/web/`:
   - 3840×2160 (4K), 2048×1152, 1600×900, 1200×675, 800×450, 480×270.
   - Formats: WebP and AVIF for stills; MP4 (H.264) + WebM (VP9/VP8 or AV1 if supported) for loops.
   - Target file size per web image: ≤300 KB for hero web variants (use AVIF/WebP + sensible compression), ≤3–5 MB per 1080×1920 loop combinaton.
3. Naming & folder convention (mandatory):
   - `/design-assets/masters/{page-slug}/{page-slug}-hero-master.tiff` (or `.mov` for master loop)
   - `/design-assets/web/{page-slug}/{page-slug}-hero-3840.avif`
   - `/design-assets/web/{page-slug}/{page-slug}-hero-1200.webp`
   - `/design-assets/web/{page-slug}/{page-slug}-loop-1080.mp4`
   - Include a JSON manifest `/design-assets/manifest.json` listing filenames, descriptions, and `srcset` lines.
4. LQIP & placeholders:
   - Generate a blurred tiny placeholder (SVG or base64) and produce a 20px blur image as `page-slug-hero-lqip.jpg`.
5. Accessibility:
   - Provide `alt` text suggestion in manifest for every image.
6. Visual uniqueness:
   - No generic “people sitting at laptops” stock clichés. All assets must be *art-directed* — show product/AI in action, abstract data flows, stylized mockups, or cinematic micro-cinematic scenes tailored to the page concept.
7. Source attribution: If any stock or third-party asset is used, include license & attribution file next to the master and use only licensed premium content.

Animation / Loop requirements:
- Loop length: 4–8 seconds (seamlessly loopable).
- Silent, muted, playsInline, autoplay, loop.
- Delivery formats: `.mp4` H.264 (fallback) + `.webm` (VP9/AV1 preferred).
- Provide a poster still optimized for first paint.

Lottie / Microinteraction requirements:
- For UI microinteractions (icons, small UI flows), produce Lottie JSON via Bodymovin export from After Effects or use LottieFiles builder.
- Provide source `.aep` files and final `lottie.json`.
- Lottie should be < 250 KB when possible and degrade to SVG fallback on unsupported browsers.

Image processing pipeline (implement or run locally in Replit):
- Use `sharp` (or Replit equivalent) to generate web sizes and AVIF/WebP:
  - sharp master.tiff --resize 3840 --toFile hero-3840.avif (quality 70)
  - sharp hero-3840.avif --resize 1200 --toFile hero-1200.webp (quality 70)
- Generate `srcset` strings in manifest.json automatically.
- Include a small script `scripts/generate-assets.js` that reads `/design-assets/masters/` and outputs `/design-assets/web/` + `manifest.json`.

Quality & creative brief rules (must be enforced before commit):
- Every hero must have:
  - a clear visual *story* tied to the page’s proposition (see per-page briefs below),
  - a unique composition (not re-used photo across pages),
  - one visual hook (motion, particle field, stylized UI, hero mock overlay).
- Avoid face-forward stock imagery. If people are used, they must feel cinematic, documentary, and brand-matched (lighting, color grade).
- Use the brand palette (dark premium background + accent teal/orange). Provide color swatches in README.

Approval checklist (assets blocked until all are met):
- 8K master exists + exported web variants for hero and 2 secondary sizes.
- Loop file (mp4 + webm) with ≤5s start/end clean loop.
- LQIP and manifest.json entries present.
- alt text written & included.
- No stock cliché usage; any third-party asset declared.

Deliverables for each page (minimum):
- `page-slug-hero-master.tiff` (or `.mov` if motion)
- `page-slug-hero-3840.avif`, `page-slug-hero-1200.webp`, `page-slug-hero-800.webp`
- `page-slug-hero-loop-1080.mp4`, `page-slug-hero-loop-1080.webm`
- `page-slug-lqip.svg` or base64
- `page-slug-icon-lottie.json` (if applicable)
- Add manifest entry with alt text, credits, and `srcset`.

Per-page art briefs (first 5 priority pages) — produce masters and web exports now:

1) **hire-ai-employees (HIRE AI EMPLOYEES page)**
- Mood: clinical + warm; smart and human-assistive (not robotic).
- Visual idea: layered scene — foreground stylized phone/desktop UI showing a support ticket resolved; midground translucent neural mesh flowing into the UI; background soft city/night bokeh. Motion: typing cursor + pulses on resolved ticket + subtle neural mesh flow left→right.
- Color: deep charcoal background, electric teal highlights, soft white UI.
- Shot & composition: 3/4 angle of device mockup (not direct screenshot). Include subtle KPI overlay (small green number animating up).
- Deliver: hero master .mov 7680×4320, loop 6s seamless. LQIP: blurred card.

2) **revenue-automation (REVENUE AUTOMATION page)**
- Mood: kinetic, data-driven, confident.
- Visual idea: abstract node/edge network with highlighted conversion path; a signal pulse travels nodes, triggers a rising bar chart on the right. Motion: a glowing pulse that runs the path and increments bars.
- Color: dark navy, neon teal, amber accent for conversion points.
- Deliver: hero master .mov 7680×4320, loop 5s; include static poster image.

3) **web-design (WEB DESIGN & LANDING PAGES)**
- Mood: premium, tactile, fast.
- Visual idea: floating layered device mockups (phone + laptop) with micro-interactions (button pulses, headline morphs). Background: soft gradient + subtle grain. Motion: micro parallax + CTA pulse.
- Styling: clean shadows, crisp typography sample shown inside mockups. Avoid generic smiling faces.
- Deliver: hero master image (prefer a still + small Lottie microinteraction for the CTA), 4K and 1200 variants.

4) **ad-creative (AD CREATIVE)**
- Mood: bold, energetic, editorial.
- Visual idea: fast cut montage style but represented as a stylized loop: split-screen frames that flip showing vertical ad frames, with motion blur and a KPI counter overlay that rises. Use creative frames (not people thumbnails).
- Color: high contrast, saturated accent palette.
- Motion: 4–6s cut rhythm loop.
- Deliver: hero .mov 6s + keyframes exported as webp sprites for fallback.

5) **social-media-creative (SOCIAL MEDIA CREATIVE)**
- Mood: native, platform-first, playful.
- Visual idea: feed simulation loop — quick vertical cards sliding up, comments/likes floating as animated micro-overlays; a highlighted post expands into a short video frame. Keep UI generic; do not emulate any platform’s UI exactly.
- Color: warm saturation, natural skin tones if people are used; but prefer stylized UGC frames (camera shake, jump cuts).
- Deliver: hero loop 5–8s + two micro-Lottie elements (reaction pop, comment float).

Asset pipeline & automation tasks to implement immediately:
- Add `scripts/generate-assets.js` (Node) to repo to:
  - Validate presence of master assets in `/design-assets/masters/`.
  - Produce WebP/AVIF and MP4/WebM outputs via sharp/ffmpeg.
  - Build `manifest.json` with `srcset` strings and alt text placeholders.
- Example commands:
  - ffmpeg (loop master to webm + optimize):  
    `ffmpeg -i master.mov -vf "scale=1920:-2,trim=duration=6,loop=0" -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 30 hero-1080.webm`
  - sharp (image resize + avif):  
    `sharp master.tiff .resize(3840).avif({quality:70}).toFile('hero-3840.avif')`
- Add a `design-assets/README.md` that lists color palette, fonts, and acceptance criteria.

If any hero master needs photography of people, brief a small directed photoshoot or high-end royalty/licensed imagery (not free stock), or use generative pipelines only if you add strong style constraints — *confirm with the client before using AI-generated faces*.

Final QA & delivery:
- For each page, create a PR under branch `oarc/blueprint-assets` with:
  - `/design-assets/masters/{page-slug}/` (master files)
  - `/design-assets/web/{page-slug}/` (web exports)
  - `design-assets/manifest.json`
  - `design-assets/README.md`
  - A short visual rationale (2–3 lines) describing why each hero matches the page proposition.
- I will review the first batch (5 pages) and sign off before mass-generating remaining pages.

Start with the five briefs above. Do not proceed to auto-generate remaining page masters until first 5 are approved.
