### Rewind to the begining

Remember the times before social media existed?

No?

Well, we do.

James, the Founder, began writing his own story from 2006 at the dawn of social media, becoming one of the world's best football freestylers, appearing in commercials with Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. James was an early pioneer of the sport, working with NIKE, Pepsi Max, Microsoft, FIFA and the UEFA Champions League. You can find his old videos on YouTube if you look hard enough!

Tassilo (Head of Brand) and James became friends in 2006 when Tassilo was one of the world's elite parkour athletes and immediately hit it off. This turned into then travelling the world and performing under the banner of Nexus Europe. Again, search YouTube; you can find the early days of vlogging!

Together, they were engrained in social content and creativity from the inception of social media, experimenting at producing content and testing methods for what worked.

In their own right, they were influencers before influencers were even a thing.

![](https://sociallypowerful.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Socially-Powerful-Story-1.jpeg)

### Getting the band together

After going separate ways for a few years, James Founded a video content and production agency called Viral Media House, where Tassilo joined as one of the first employees.

The idea behind the agency was to create viral content for brands and distribute it across social platforms such as YouTube where brands began to experiment with social content.

In James' words, "Viral Media House in concept was brilliant, but what we were looking to do for brands was too early in the social marketing evolution."

"We had big ideas. But had no clients that would take the chance in buying them!"

"It got to the stage where I had to decide: keep going and keep the faith, or shut the whole thing down."

Then, what happened changed the shape of the agency entirely.

An opportunity to work on an influencer campaign, which the guys had zero knowledge of or experience in.

Somehow, we delivered a campaign in an industry we knew nothing about and had it trending #1 on Twitter.

Seemed like fate?

![](https://sociallypowerful.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG-7773-e1695028846238.jpeg)

### The birth

After James fumbling around with various agency names, Socially Powerful was born in early 2017, with the first agency website built in about 20 minutes.

Tassilo joined him on the journey, later becoming Co-Founder.

It was the right product at the right time, and we won fantastic clients in the agency's infancy, but we quickly realised we needed help.

We needed to learn about finance operations and enter Majid to join as the CEO - a management consultant from EY who brought in processes, a clear direction and how to budget.

Then we realised, whilst it was incredible to get marketing campaigns trending on social, how do we make sense of the data and show more than just the vanity numbers. In came Cyrille, an insight wizard from WPP.

![](https://sociallypowerful.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-18-at-14.44.38.png)

### The journey

From day 1 of starting the agency, Tass and James vlogged their journey, continuing a theme that had followed them their entire careers: creating content and being practitioners.

The content went out, whether a POV on the latest trending topics or vlogging their days in London going to meetings. Some good, some bad and some hidden from YouTube forever!

We decided to hire a video team before we had employees following Tass around as he toured the world visiting our clients from China to the US, Canada, and Europe.

The content produced was simply spectacular, and we will cherish it forever.

What happened next is something we could never have imagined...

![](https://sociallypowerful.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-18-at-14.42.50.png)

### The loss

While on one of his trips worldwide, meeting our clients, Tassilo started suffering from crippling back pain.

After several trips to the hospital, Tassilo received the news that he had been diagnosed with Leukaemia.

As with anything, Tassilo went into treatment full steam ahead, immersing himself in knowledge and discovering everything he could about Leukaemia.

He stayed involved in the business, doing anything he could to help build Socially Powerful whilst undergoing severe treatment. Which involved pitching to clients, working with the team on proposals, negotiating deals and giving keynote talks.

He took the vlog on the journey with him every step of the way, right to the end. We look back at every video he made with the fondest of memories.

In September 2018, Tassilo passed away, and we miss him every day.

### Our first international office ??

In 2019, Socially Powerful launched our first international office in China. This was a bold move for us and we embarked on an exciting and transformative journey, with Beijing chosen as the destination of choice.

The decision to expand internationally marked the beginning of an incredible learning adventure, as Socially Powerful sought to navigate diverse cultures and markets while leveraging its expertise in social media and influencer marketing. This strategic step demonstrated the company's commitment to staying at the forefront of the industry and its dedication to serving clients worldwide.

The team expanded with incredible client wins via Huawei, ByteDance, Xiaomi, DJI, OPPO, OnePlus and many other major Chinese brands.

### Going Stateside ??

In 2022, Socially Powerful achieved another significant milestone by launching its second international office, this time in the United States.

It served as a powerful statement, firmly planting the company's flag in the U.S. market. Socially Powerful's decision to establish a presence in the United States was driven by its remarkable growth and the recognition of the immense potential this market held for its social media and influencer marketing expertise. This strategic move reinforced the company's dedication to delivering exceptional services to its American clients while further solidifying its reputation as an industry leader.

![](https://sociallypowerful.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6e35c17b-b0b1-48c2-b84c-27a2a04214e4.jpg)

### Where are we now?

We've now built a global social marketing agency with over 80 employees globally (you can see some of them here), working with the biggest brands in the world to deliver best-in-class social campaigns.

We speak over 20 different languages.

We have offices in London, Europe, North America and the Middle East.

We've expanded from influencer marketing to an all-encompassing social-first marketing agency and truly believe we are only at the beginning of our agency story.

Watch what happens over the next few years; it will be an exciting journey.

The industry is here to stay; we're at the front of it, shaping it as we go.

![](https://sociallypowerful.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shridhar-gupta-dZxQn4VEv2M-unsplash-scaled.jpg)

### The future?

Our focus is on technology, using AI to build solutions that give our agency the edge over the competition and help our clients achieve greatness across social media and unstoppable campaigns.

## What Is the Story Behind Socially Powerful?

Socially Powerful was born from the grassroots of early internet culture long before the term “influencer” ever existed. It all began in 2006, when James Hacking, a world-renowned football freestyler, and Tassilo, an elite parkour athlete, were creating content, building communities, and pushing the limits of creativity on platforms like YouTube.

When founder Tassilo was diagnosed with leukemia, he courageously continued building the agency through treatment, pitching to clients, developing proposals, and sharing his journey via vlogs. He became part of our identity and even after his passing in September 2018, his legacy continues to inspire us every day.

Socially Powerful took its first major leap beyond the UK, in 2019, by opening an office in Beijing and partnered with Chinese giants like Huawei, ByteDance, Xiaomi, DJI, OPPO, and OnePlus. It was a bold move that reflects our dedication to global growth and cultural fluency. We entered the U.S. market in 2022 and established a transatlantic presence that reinforced our status as a truly global agency.

Socially Powerful has more than 100 employees today, speaking over 20 languages and offices across London, Europe, North America, and the Middle East. We have transformed from an influencer marketing startup into a social-first powerhouse.
